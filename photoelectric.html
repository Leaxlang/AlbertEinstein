<h1>The Photoelectric Effect</h1>


<p>
    The photoelectric effect solved the question of whether light is made up of particles 
    or waves. It is an interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. Electrons 
    are released from the surface if you shine a light with the right wavelength onto a 
    negatively charged metal surface. 
</p>

<p>
    What are the consequences this effect has?
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Light is neither made of particles nor waves but in small energy portions called Photons.</li>
        <li>The intensity of light is determined by the frequency and not amplitude.</li>
        <li>Brighter light has more Photons, not Photons with higher energy.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This effect is only possible below a specific wavelength (or above a specific frequency).

<p class="quote">
    According to the assumption considered here, when a light ray starting from a 
    point is propagated, the energy is not continuously distributed over an ever 
    increasing volume, but it consists of a finite number of energy quanta, localized 
    in space, which move without being divided and which can be absorbed or emitted only 
    as a whole.

    and Transformation of Light")
