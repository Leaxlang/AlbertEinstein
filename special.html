<h1>Special Theory of Relativity</h1>
<!-- <h2></h2> -->

    <p class="quote">
        In order to have a complete description of the
        motion, we must specify how the body alters its
        position with time; i.e. for every point on the
        trajectory it must be stated at what time the
        body is situated there. 
        <br>(Albert Einstein, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies")
    </p>

    <p>
        The special theory of relativity is based on two postulates.
        <ol type="1">
            <li>The principle of relativity</li>
            <li>The speed of light is invariant</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>The principle of relativity </h3>
    <p>To visualize the concept of an inertial frame of reference, Einstein uses the thought experiment of sitting on a train. When sitting in a train in motion, everything inside will appear to a person inside as stationary, as the observer and the train are moving at the same speed. The outside world seems to be moving. What happens when you throw a ball straight into the air while being at a constant speed on that train? It will not behave any differently than standing still at the train station. </p>

    <h3>Invariance of the speed of light </h3>
    <p>Before Einstein, there was a hypothesis on how light moves through the air called the Ether Hypothesis. It was believed that light waves travel through a medium called ether, like water waves, and sound waves need a medium to get transmitted. This theory got disproved with the Michelson-Morley Interferometer. This interferometer compares the optical path length for light moving in perpendicular directions. If there were a medium for light, the length of these paths would be different, which would have resulted in a different interference pattern than observed. Therefore is, the speed of light constant, and there is no light ether.</p>

    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <p>The truth of both these postulates leads to some consequences: </p>

    <h3>Simultaneity</h3>
    <p>If two spatial separated events occur at the same time depends on the observer's frame of reference. </p>

    <h3>Time dilation </h3>
    <p>
        Time observed by a moving observer will be slower than by a stationary one. <br>
        This effect was also measured in an experiment. One atomic clock was stationary on earth; the other was flown at high speeds in a plane. The clock on the plane moved slower than the one on earth.

    </p>

    <h3>Length contraction</h3>
    <p>Similar to time dilation, an object in motion will appear shorted in the direction of movement. Both of these effects can be calculated with the Lorentz transformation. Where L Ìƒ is the length of an object as a function with the velocity v. L_0 is the length of an object at rest, and c is the speed of light.</p>
    <img class="formula" src="formula-1.png">
    <p>This calculation only becomes only important when the velocity is high. For example, adding v1 = 0.5c and v2 = 0.8c (when they are parallel) is impossible because nothing can be faster than the speed of light. </p>
    <img class="formula" src="formula-2.png">
    <p>Calculating the total speed with a relativistic approach leads to a different result.</p>
    <img class="formula" src="formula-3.png">
    <p>We can use a modified version of this formula to show why moving at the speed of light is impossible or at least very difficult. 
        <br>With </p>
    <img class="formula" src="formula-4.png">
    <p>we can calculate how much energy is needed to move at the speed of light.  v -> c</p>
    <img class="formula" src="formula-5.png">
    <p>Infinite energy is needed to move at the speed of light.</p>
