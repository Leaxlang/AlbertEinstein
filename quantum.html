<h1>Quantumphysics</h1>
<!-- <h2>The Genius who revolutionized modern Physics</h2> -->
<p>Our view of atoms has changed because of Quantum Physics. 
    In the past, an atom was portrayed as a nucleus orbited by electrons. 
    Modern quantum physics describes the probability of the location of an electron in a
     time frame. Electrons can jump from one orbital to another as they gain or lose energy, 
     but they cannot be found between orbitals.</p>

    <h3>Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
    <p>This principle is the result of experiments showing that light can have the properties 
        of particles or waves depending on how it was measured. Today we know that these forms 
        of energy are neither particles nor wave but instead distinct quantum objects. </p>

    <h3>Superposition</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Uncertatity Principle</h3>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3>Entanglement</h3>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3>The Double Slit Experiment</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most definitive experiment in the field of quantum physics is the double-slit experiment. This experiment, 
        which involves shooting particles such as photons or electrons though a barrier with two slits, was originally used in 
        1801 to show that light is made up of waves. Since then, numerous incarnations of the experiment have been used to demonstrate 
        that matter can also behave like a wave and to demonstrate the principles of superposition, entanglement, and the observer effect.</p>
