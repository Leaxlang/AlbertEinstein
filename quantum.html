<h1>Quantum Physics</h1>
<!-- <h2>The Genius who revolutionized modern Physics</h2> -->
<p>Our view of atoms has changed because of Quantum Physics. In the past, an atom was portrayed as a nucleus orbited by electrons. Modern quantum physics describes the probability of the location of an electron in a time frame. Electrons can jump from one orbital to another depending wether they gain or lose energy, but they cannot be inbetween orbitals.</p>

    <h3>Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
    <p>This principle is the result of experiments showing that light can have the property of particles or waves depending on how it was measured. Today we know that these forms of energy are neither particles nor waves but instead distinct quantum objects. </p>

    <h3>Superposition</h3>
    <p>The Term "Superposition" describes when an object has multiple states simultaneously. An object in superposition can have more than one solution to an equation. </p>

    <h3>Uncertatity Principle</h3>
    <p>With a quantum object, we can not know the precise position and velocity simultaneously. If we know the exact position of an electron, we do not know its actual speed. </p>
    
    <h3>Entanglement</h3>
    <p>Entanglement occurs when two or more objects are connected to each other so that they can be thought of as existing in a single system, even though their position might be far apart. These objects can only be fully described by knowing the other object. But this also means that learning information about one object automatically tells you information about the other object.</p>
    
    <h3>The Double Slit Experiment</h3>
    <p>One of the most famous experiments in quantum physics is the double-slit experiment. Originally used to prove that light behaves like a wave in 1801, it has evolved and demonstrated superposition, entanglement, and the observer effect principles.  </p>
