    There are two papers by Albert Einstein about the theory of relativity. The first one is the special theory of relativity, published in 1905, which explains how speed affects mass, time, and space. The second one is the general theory of relativity, which got popularized in 1916; it is about gravity and the curvature of spacetime. His view understanding of the universe was and remains incredible. Thinking about some of the consequences of relativity can give you a headache.

    An essential concept for the theory of relativity is the inertial reference frame:<br>
    It is a state or frame of reference where Newton's laws hold true because no external force is acting on the body. It is at rest or in uniform motion. There is no preferred frame and no absolute motion.
